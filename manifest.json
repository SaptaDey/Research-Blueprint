  "description": "An intensive graph-based framework for scientific reasoning that implements the Advanced Scientific Reasoning Graph-of-Thoughts (ASR-GoT) methodology for complex research analysis and hypothesis generation.",
  "long_description": "This extension provides a comprehensive implementation of the ASR-GoT framework, enabling researchers to perform systematic scientific reasoning through an 8-stage graph-based methodology. It supports interdisciplinary research, causal inference, temporal analysis, statistical validation, and collaborative research workflows. Designed specifically for advanced scientific research with features like multi-dimensional confidence tracking, bias detection, knowledge gap identification, and impact estimation.",
